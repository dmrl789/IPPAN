# Fee Caps and DAG-Fair Emission System

This document defines IPPAN’s **fee system**, **DAG-Fair emission schedule**, and **reward distribution model**.  
It merges the protocol specification (for implementation) with concise economic rationale (for whitepaper/governance).

## 1. Fee System

### 1.1 Overview

IPPAN enforces **hard, deterministic fee caps** at the protocol level to ensure predictable costs, fairness, and resistance to manipulation.  
Transactions that exceed their allowed fee cap are **rejected deterministically** during both **mempool admission** and **block assembly**.

### 1.2 Fee Cap Table

| Transaction Type     | Cap (µIPN) | Cap (IPN)  | Description                         |
|----------------------|------------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Transfer             | 1,000      | 0.00001    | Simple token transfer               |
| AI Call              | 100        | 0.000001   | AI model inference call             |
| Contract Deploy      | 100,000    | 0.001      | Deploy smart contract               |
| Contract Call        | 10,000     | 0.0001     | Execute contract method             |
| Governance           | 10,000     | 0.0001     | Governance proposal or vote         |
| Validator Operations | 10,000     | 0.0001     | Stake, register, or update node     |

### 1.3 Fee Formula

Protocol-fee calculation (issuer-facing) is simple and deterministic:
