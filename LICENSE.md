## 1. Definitions

In this license:

- **“IPPAN Foundation”** means **IPPAN FOUNDATION**, or any legal successor that governs the IPPAN Project.

- **“You”** means any individual or entity who accesses the IPPAN source code in any way (viewing, cloning, copying, compiling, running, or modifying).

- **“Official IPPAN Network(s)”** means any testnet, devnet, or mainnet that is publicly designated as an official IPPAN network by the IPPAN Foundation.

- **“Derived Work”** means any work based on or including the IPPAN source code, in whole or in part, including modifications, forks, ports, or integrations.

## 2. Ownership

The IPPAN source code is owned by the IPPAN Foundation and/or its contributors.  
By making the source code available, the IPPAN Foundation is **not** transferring ownership to you.  
You are only granted the limited rights described in this license.

## 3. What You Are Allowed to Do

Subject to the terms of this license, you may:

1. **Read and study the code**
   - View, clone, and locally copy the code for the purpose of reading, analyzing, understanding, auditing, and learning from it.

2. **Develop and test**
   - Build and run the software on your own machines for:
     - Local development,
     - Testing and experimentation,
     - Research and academic work.
   - Create modifications for the purpose of proposing improvements back to the official IPPAN repositories (for example, via pull requests).

3. **Run nodes on Official IPPAN Networks**
   - Run the software to operate nodes (validator, full node, observer, or similar roles) on **Official IPPAN Network(s)**, provided that:
     - You comply with any separate node/operator agreements, policies, or terms set by the IPPAN Foundation.
     - You do not alter the protocol in a way that breaks compatibility with the Official IPPAN Network, except for development and testing purposes.

4. **Use in non-commercial, internal environments**
   - Use the software internally (within your organization) for evaluation, prototyping, or proofs-of-concept, as long as this does **not** constitute:
     - A public or commercial network offering,
     - A blockchain/SaaS product offered to third parties, or
     - A competing infrastructure service.

---

## 4. What You Are Not Allowed to Do (Without Written Permission)

Unless you receive **prior written consent** from the IPPAN Foundation, you may **not**:

1. **Run competing public or private networks**
   - Launch or operate any **public** or **commercial** network (blockchain, distributed ledger, token network, or similar system) based on this software or any Derived Work **that is not an Official IPPAN Network**.
   - Run a private or consortium network based on this software or any Derived Work if that network is offered as a product, service, or solution to third parties.

2. **Offer competing services**
   - Use the software or any Derived Work to offer:
     - “Blockchain as a Service,”
     - Infrastructure hosting,
     - Node hosting, RPC endpoints, or protocol-level tooling,
     - Or any other commercial product that competes with or substitutes for services that the IPPAN Foundation or its affiliates may provide.

3. **Redistribute the code as your own product**
   - Redistribute the IPPAN software, modified or unmodified, as a standalone product, SDK, or library under your own brand or license.
   - Re-license or sub-license the IPPAN code or any Derived Work under different terms.

4. **Use IPPAN trademarks**
   - Use the names **“IPPAN”**, **“IPN”**, **“HashTimer”**, the IPPAN logo, or any confusingly similar marks:
     - To name or brand your own network, product, or service; or
     - In a way that suggests endorsement, sponsorship, or official affiliation,
