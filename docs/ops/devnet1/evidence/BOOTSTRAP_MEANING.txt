BOOTSTRAP_NODES MEANING - Code Analysis
========================================

1. CONFIGURATION SOURCE:
   - Location: `node/src/main.rs` line 426-441
   - Config key: `p2p.bootstrap_nodes` (TOML) or `BOOTSTRAP_NODES` (env)
   - Format: Comma-separated URLs (e.g., "http://188.245.97.41:8080")

2. USAGE:
   - Passed to P2P network as `bootstrap_peers` in `DhtConfig` (line 1305)
   - Used by HTTP P2P network's `start()` method (line 380-384)
   - Each bootstrap URL is passed to `add_peer()` method

3. ADD_PEER BEHAVIOR:
   - Location: `crates/p2p/src/lib.rs` line 413-467
   - Makes HTTP requests to bootstrap node URLs
   - Uses the URL as-is (no port transformation)
   - Connects to `/p2p/peer-discovery` and `/p2p/peer-info` endpoints

4. CRITICAL FINDING:
   - P2P endpoints are on RPC port (8080), NOT on P2P port (9000)
   - Evidence: `/p2p/peers`, `/p2p/peer-discovery` are RPC routes (crates/rpc/src/server.rs line 1462-1468)
   - Therefore: bootstrap_nodes should use port 8080, not 9000

5. PORT CONFUSION:
   - Config shows `[p2p] port = 9000` but this is NOT used for HTTP P2P
   - The `listen_address` uses p2p_port (9000) but actual HTTP endpoints are on RPC (8080)
   - This is why nodes advertise themselves with :9000 but connections fail

CONCLUSION:
- bootstrap_nodes URLs should point to RPC port (8080) for HTTP P2P networking
- The p2p.port = 9000 in config is misleading - actual P2P HTTP endpoints are on RPC port 8080
- Current devnet configs correctly use port 8080 after our fixes
