# IPPAN Documentation

This directory contains all IPPAN documentation. **Start at [`docs/INDEX.md`](INDEX.md)** for the single entry point to all essential documentation.

## Organization

- **`docs/INDEX.md`** - Single source of truth entry point (start here)
- **`docs/`** - Deep dives and detailed guides
- **`docs/issues/`** - Readiness tracking and issue documentation
- **`docs/archive/`** - Historical reports and archived materials

## Keeping Docs Up to Date

- **Prefer updating INDEX links** over creating new scattered documentation
- **Deprecate outdated docs** by adding a DEPRECATED banner at the top (see examples in deprecated docs)
- **Merge overlapping content** rather than maintaining duplicates
- **Archive historical reports** in `docs/archive/` rather than deleting

## Quick Links

- **For Developers**: See [INDEX.md](INDEX.md#for-developers)
- **For Auditors**: See [INDEX.md](INDEX.md#for-auditors)
- **Operations/Release**: See [INDEX.md](INDEX.md#operations--release)

**Questions?** Update `docs/INDEX.md` to add missing links or consolidate overlapping docs.
