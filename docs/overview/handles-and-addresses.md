The canonical guide for mapping wallet `@handles` to their underlying addresses lives in [`docs/users/handles-and-addresses.md`](docs/users/handles-and-addresses.md).

Use it to learn how human-readable handles wrap the same Ed25519 public keys as standard IPPAN addresses, along with CLI and RPC examples for registering and resolving handles.
