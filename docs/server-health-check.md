# Server Health Check Report

Date: 2025-10-08T07:21:48Z

## Summary

Attempted to query the public health endpoint for the unified UI deployment at `https://ui.ippan.org/health`. The request could not be completed from the current execution environment because the outbound HTTPS tunnel was blocked by a proxy, returning HTTP 403.

## Command Output

```
curl -sS https://ui.ippan.org/health
curl: (56) CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403
```

## Notes

- No additional servers were reachable from this environment, so further health verification steps (checking `/api/health`, `/status`, `/peers`, or load balancer endpoints) could not be executed.
- Re-run this checklist from an environment with direct network access to the production servers or via the prescribed GitHub workflow (`docs/codex-check-nodes.md`).
